# CEO / BOARD — DECISION BRIEF: UĞURLULAR TEKSTIL

**DATE:** 2025-12-24
**TO:** Board of Directors, CEO
**FROM:** Zero@Ecosystem Decision Engine
**SUBJECT:** MARKET ACCESS RETENTION & PORTFOLIO PIVOT

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**Compliance is not an IT project. It is a market access condition.**
Uğurlular Tekstil faces immediate exclusion risks from EU Tier-1 supply chains due to the Green Claims Directive and ESPR. The current portfolio reliance on generic Bamboo (greenwashing risk) and Acrylic (fossil fuel reliance) is a liability. Immediate pivot to data-backed Regenerative and Tencel lines is required to preserve revenue and secure future margins. **Inaction guarantees market share loss by 2026.**

## 2. KILL / SCALE / INVEST / TRANSFORM

| DECISION | CATEGORY | MATERIAL | RATIONALE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **KILL** | **Toxic Asset** | **Generic Bamboo** | High legal risk under EU Green Claims Directive. Unverifiable sourcing. |
| **KILL** | **Carbon Liability** | **High-% Acrylic** | Exposed to CBAM carbon taxes. Margin erosion inevitable. |
| **SCALE** | **Hero Product** | **Regenerative Cotton** | High demand, premium pricing (+15%), exempt from penalties. |
| **SCALE** | **Hero Product** | **Tencel / Modal** | Proven low-impact, traceable, EU-preferred. |
| **INVEST** | **Infrastructure** | **DPP / Traceability** | Digital Product Passports are the "entry ticket" for 2026 tenders. |
| **TRANSFORM**| **Defense** | **Standard Cotton** | Retain volume but require energy data validation to prevent commoditization. |

## 3. STRATEGIC ROADMAP (18 MONTHS)

### PHASE 1: PURGE & PIVOT (Months 1-6)
*   **MANDATE:** Stop procurement of generic Bamboo fiber.
*   **ACTION:** Liquidate existing "Exit" inventory.
*   **ACTION:** Launch "Zero@Yarn" Regenerative collection with full DPP.

### PHASE 2: SYSTEM INTEGRATION (Months 7-12)
*   **MANDATE:** 100% of EU shipments must have Digital Product Passport.
*   **ACTION:** Integrate energy/water data into sales pricing.
*   **GOAL:** Secure "Preferred Vendor" status with top 5 EU brands.

### PHASE 3: MARKET DOMINANCE (Months 13-18)

---

## 4. RISK OF INACTION (BUSINESS-AS-USUAL)
If we maintain the current portfolio:
1.  **De-listing:** Tier-1 brands will remove Uğurlular from vendor lists to protect their own compliance scores.
2.  **Inventory Write-off:** €0.8M - €1.2M in unsellable Bamboo/Acrylic stock.
3.  **Margin Compression:** Forced to compete solely on price against non-compliant competitors.

---

## 5. FIRST 90 DAYS — DECISION VALIDATION WINDOW
*   **Checkpoint Date:** March 24, 2026
*   **Success Metric:** Zero new procurement orders for "Kill" materials.
*   **Success Metric:** 3 Pilot programs signed for Regenerative Cotton with DPP.
