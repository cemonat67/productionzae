# CFO / FINANCE — IMPACT SNAPSHOT: UĞURLULAR TEKSTIL

**DATE:** 2025-12-24
**TO:** CFO, Finance Committee
**FROM:** Zero@Ecosystem Decision Engine
**SUBJECT:** FINANCIAL EXPOSURE & VALUE CREATION (2026-2027)

---

## 1. FINANCIAL RISK EXPOSURE (IF WE DO NOTHING)
**Total Risk Exposure: €3.5M - €5.0M Annualized**

*   **Inventory Devaluation:** **€1.2M** (Estimated book value of "Kill" category yarns - Bamboo/Acrylic).
*   **Revenue at Risk:** **€3.8M** (Projected loss of Tier-1 EU accounts due to non-compliance).
*   **CBAM Penalties:** **Unpriced but Material** (Carbon tax on fossil-based fibers entering EU).

---

## 2. HIDDEN LIABILITIES
The balance sheet currently hides regulatory debts:
*   **Greenwashing Litigation:** Potential fines up to 4% of annual turnover under Green Claims Directive for unsubstantiated "Eco" Bamboo claims.
*   **Energy Leakage:** Inefficient production lines increase Scope 2 emissions, directly inflating CBAM costs for clients, making our yarn "financially toxic."
*   **Inventory Obsolescence:** "Exit" materials are accumulating warehousing costs while becoming legally unsellable in target markets.

## 3. VALUE CREATION & ROI TABLE

| INITIATIVE | INVESTMENT (CAPEX/OPEX) | EXPECTED ROI | TIMEFRAME |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Regenerative Fiber Sourcing** | OPEX (Higher COGS) | **+15% Gross Margin** (Premium Pricing) | 6 Months |
| **DPP Implementation** | CAPEX (Software/Integration) | **Account Retention** (Preserves €3.8M Revenue) | Immediate |
| **Energy Monitoring** | CAPEX (Sensors/IoT) | **10% Energy Saving** + CBAM Reduction | 12-18 Months |

---

## 4. CAPEX vs OPEX CLASSIFICATION
*   **OPEX (Shift):** Reallocate procurement budget from Bamboo/Acrylic to Regenerative/Tencel. Net neutral impact on cash flow, positive impact on margin.
*   **CAPEX (New):** Digital Product Passport infrastructure and verified data systems. Essential specifically for **Market Access**.

---

## 5. STATUS QUO COST OWNER
**Who pays if we delay?**
*   **Sales Director:** Absorbs the revenue loss from de-listed accounts.
*   **Operations Director:** Absorbs the write-off cost of obsolete inventory.
*   **CFO:** Responsible for explaining the 4% turnover fine risk to the Board.
